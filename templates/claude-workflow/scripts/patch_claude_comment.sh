# Patch the latest Claude-authored comment on an issue/PR with the
# authoritative LLM footer (and an optional workflow status note).
#
# Env: REPO, ISSUE_NUMBER, GH_TOKEN, MODEL_ID, EFFORT, CLAUDE_HARNESS,
#      STATUS_NOTE (optional) — the last four are consumed by
#      compose_claude_comment.py.
#      BOT_LOGIN (optional, default claude[bot]) — which author's comment to
#      patch. The least-privilege review job (#1178) binds the agent to the
#      job token, so its comments post as github-actions[bot].
#      RUN_ID (optional) — when set, only comments embedding this run's
#      /actions/runs/<RUN_ID> link qualify. github-actions[bot] is a shared
#      author (any workflow posts as it), so latest-by-author alone could
#      stamp a foreign comment; the action's tracking comment always links
#      its own run. Deliberately no PATCH fallback on miss: a missing footer
#      is benign, patching another workflow's comment is not.
#      ON_MISS (optional, default skip) — "post" makes a miss post a NEW
#      comment carrying STATUS_NOTE instead of exiting silently. Set by the
#      cancellation/failure step: a failure before the action creates its
#      tracking comment (checkout, setup, prompt composition) must still
#      surface in the thread — the only channel the user watches — without
#      misattributing the note to an older run's comment. Requires a
#      non-empty STATUS_NOTE (a footer-only comment is noise).
#      TARGET_COMMENT_ID (optional) — patch THIS comment id directly, skipping
#      the paginated author/run selection. The implement footer step captures
#      the primary work comment id BEFORE the CLAUDE.md-revision pass (which
#      posts its own claude[bot] comment sharing this run's link) and pins the
#      footer to it, so the footer never lands on the revise-pass comment.
#      SELECT_ONLY (optional) — resolve and print the target comment id to
#      stdout, then exit without patching. Used to capture that pinned id.
#
# Fetches ALL comment pages (--paginate --slurp; gh api returns 30 comments
# per page, and long review threads exceed that) so the true latest bot
# comment is resolved. Body composition is delegated to
# compose_claude_comment.py so both workflow patch steps share one
# implementation.
